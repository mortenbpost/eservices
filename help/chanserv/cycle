Syntax: CYCLE <#channel>
  
CYCLE makes the channel service cycle the channel specified, ie. part
the channel, join the channel and be opped by services.
 
This command should only be used in case of a desync, that is, if it
for some reason is not opped, due to a netsplit/netjoin.
 
Abuse of this command will most likely result in a ban from the 
network and the channel will be disabled immediately.
